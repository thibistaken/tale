Bitcoin profundly changes the self. It is mind-bending. It changes me everyday. The orange pill expands the mind and helps me think about many subject matters, such as monetary history, economics, nutrition, family, markets, philosophy, political theory or stoïcism. These are some of my current curiosities. I know I'm not alone in this.

During this journey of intellectual discovery, I'm on Twitter learning from and growing with individuals in the cyberspace. There is a fundamental shift towards individual sovereignty, and I trust this site in being a forum where I can expand on these ideas.

While reading articles, listening to podcasts or writing and talking about Bitcoin, I've become fascinated by its inevitable force altering our societal norms—changing the individual working towards achieving true sovereignty and ultimate self responsibility. Get your house in order, or get out.

I write about some of these reflections on this blog. Obviously, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thibm_). You can also email me [here](mailto:hito@thibm.net)

Peace.
