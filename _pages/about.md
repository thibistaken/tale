Bitcoin profundly changes the self. It is mind-bending. It changes me everyday. The orange pill expands the mind and helps me think about many subject matters. Monetary history, economics, nutrition, family, markets, philosophy, political theory and stoïcism are some of these curiosities. I know I'm not alone in this.

During this journey of intellectual discovery, I'm on Twitter learning from people and some individuals that I'm lucky to now call friends, some of whom I have never met in meatspace.

While reading articles or listening to podcasts about Bitcoin, I've become fascinated by its inevitable force altering our societal norms—changing the individual working towards achieving true sovereignty.

I write about some of these reflections on this blog. Obviously, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thibm_). Drop me a line if you want to chat [here](mailto:hito@thibm.net)

Peace.
